# Code-Quiz
Build a timed coding quiz with muiltiple choice questions

I wanted to use html, css and java to make a simple code quiz. This gave me a better understanding of the dynamism that java can have used correctly. im still learning the basics really and did at times struggle with this task making sure the functions and arrays worked correctly in java. But week by week I will put one foot in front of the other to get to grips with different tools at my disposal.
